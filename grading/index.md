## Formative Assessment

Students will attend weekly tutor meetings, in which the individual learning progress and success will be discussed.
These meetings provide formative feedback to the students.
They provide an opportunity to reflect and learn and are not considered in the final grade.

## Pass/fail Elements (for individual students)

- Professional attitude and contributions throughout the project
- Contribution of an accepted merge request of reasonable size (week 4)
- Contribution of a substantial (source-code) feature to the final product
- Passing the “Information Literacy” course
- Participation in all peer reviews, positive evaluation in final peer review
- Ability to explain and defend individual project contributions in the final presentation.
- Attendance of all tutor and client meetings. Absence can be excused, if a valid reason is indicated before the meeting. The validity of your reasons will be judged case by case through the course staff and/or the academic counselors. Missing one meeting unexcused will result in a penalty on your final grade, missing multiple meetings can result in an insufficient final grade.

## Summative Assessment (for the group grade)

The final grade for the grade depends on various factors.

- 40% [Process]({% link grading/process/index.md %}) (focus: How well did the group work together?)
- 20% [Design Document]({% link grading/design-document/index.md %}) (focus: Validate learning objectives on design principles and information literacy)
- 40% [Product]({% link grading/product/index.md %}) (focus: How well has the application been implemented?)

Please note that:

- All listed (sub-) points represent components that must ALL be passed to receive a positive overall grade.
- There is NO resit opportunity for this course.
- Partial grades are not carried over to the next academic year.
