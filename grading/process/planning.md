## Task have an appropriate granularity

Sufficient
: High-level features are broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be finished by a single developer.
Several all tasks are not precisely defined and contain no or ambiguous descriptions for what to do and when to stop.

Excellent
: Most tasks are well defined and clearly describe the expected outcome and when they are done. Tasks are typically small enough that it does not take longer than a day to finish them.

## Task Distribution

Sufficient
: All team members have contributed a substantial part in all deliverables of the project.

Excellent
: The team has tried to equally distribute implementation tasks among the team members. More experienced/efficient developers have used their time to take a leading role in the project or to support others in their learning process.

## Estimations

Sufficient
: Most tasks have an estimate.

Excellent
: Most tasks have an estimate, which is established in a team process (e.g., planning poker). Estimates of the upcoming tasks are being updated every week.

## Plan is adapted over the weeks

Sufficient
: The team uses issues to track their current activities in an ad-hoc manner. Throughout the project, new tasks are being added and existing ones removed or changed, but the active tasks usually only reflect the very next steps.

Excellent
: The team uses issues and milestones to plan their future activities. Relevant events (unforeseen problems, updated estimates, ...) are taken into consideration and the overall task planning of all remaining tasks is regularly updated, for example, as preparation for the weekly TA meeting.
