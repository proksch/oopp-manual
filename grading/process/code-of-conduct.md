title: Code of Conduct
---


## The agreements cover various situations that are closely related to the project

A code of conduct can cover a wide range of topics that are closely relevant for the project. Agreements can be related, for example, to topics in the following, non-exhaustive list:

{:.dense}
- Team communication
- Grade aspiration
- Inter-cultural differences
- Meeting organization
- Team Roles and Processes
- Deadlines
- Punctuality
- Prefered working hours
- Handling of mistakes

Please note that it is possible to agree on several things in one category.


Sufficient
: The code of conduct has a reasonable extent and has at least eight distinct agreements with a connection to the project.

Excellent
: The code of conduct contains a wide range of agreements that span over many categories. All agreements are closely related to the project.


## The agreements are specific and relate to concrete situations

Sufficient
: Most agreements are related to activities or challenges in a typical group project among students.

Excellent
: The relation to specific activities or challenges that the group will face in the project is immediately clear for most agreements.


## The agreements are measurable and contain clear criteria to achieve their goals

Sufficient
: A rough definition is given for most of the agreements. A gut-feeling or empathy is required for several agreements to understand when they have been broken.

Excellent
: Most agreements are well defined. They describe both a concrete metric and an umambiguos criterion.


## The agreements are realistic and can actually be realized

Sufficient
: The agreements might be ambitious, but can help a well-attuned group to further improve their performance.

Excellent
: Most agreements acknowledge the tight duration of the project, the random group composition, and that the team is working in a distributed manner, both spatially and temporally.


## The code of conduct defines consequences for breaking the agreements

The term "consequences" is meant in a broad way. Consequences could be a discussion in an extra-ordinary team meeting or clear criteria for when to escalate issues to the project organization.

Sufficient
: The code of conduct lists consequences.

Excellent
: Consequences are not just punishments and show clear intention to improve the group climate.


## The code of conduct describes a change process

The code of conduct is a living document that should evolve together with the group. The group should describe how they plan to keep it up-to-date.

Sufficient
: The group acknowledges that updates might become necessary and describe a reactive process.

Excellent
: The group plans a pro-active process to actively and systematically discover issues and opportunities for improvement.





## Not part of the rubric

The lecture has introduced "acceptability" (The CoC contains only proposals against which no member of the team has any moral objections). And "Time restriction" (The CoC contains only items chat can be realized in the time available) as additional requirements for the code of conduct. These are important and should be considered by the team when the CoC is created, however, these points are impossible for us to measure. As a result, they are not part of the final rubric.
