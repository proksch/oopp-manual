The product grade makes up 40% of the overall grade and largely depends on the extent to which the application fulfills the product requirements.

Obviously, releasing the grading rubric upfront would provide a blueprint for the requirements engineering phase, particularly for the [Backlog]({% link grading/process/backlog.md  %}),
As a a result, the rubric will not be available right from the start.
Instead, it will be released right after the requirements engineering phase ended to give everybody a fair chance to get the maximum grade for the product-related part of the grading.
